Hello! I'm a software developer.

In previous lives I was a lawyer and a martial arts instructor.

I'm currently considering how to focus my career. I think that ideally, I'd be able to do something with applied math, systems programming, and numerical computing. I'm also interested in physics and systems like modeling turbulence, but need to learn more about it. Guidance and suggestions are welcome!

### Career interests:

- Math
- Data engineering
- Backend services
- Internal tooling and CLI tools
- Rust (the language)

### Hobbies:

- Yoga / qi gong
- Go (aka weiqi) the board game
- Playing music
- Table Tennis
