This is my first wilderness backpacking trip since childhood! Lately I've been wanting to recapture the nostalgia of a trip I took while in the Boy Scouts. We hiked up to Saddleback Lake, near Bishop Pass in the Sierras, where I spent a full day exploring the shoreline and unsuccessfully fishing for trout.

The most recent impetus was two trips: the first, a snowshoe to a hut by Mt. Bigelow in Maine last winter, and then a trek through Morocco's Atlas Mountains soon after. I guess it had just been a really long time since I'd been out of the city, and I'd forgotten the joy and the peace I felt there.

With the spark rekindled, I immediately started looking into equipment (basically starting again from scratch). While the nature part of Boy Scouts backpacking left a warm feeling, the counterpart was a certain amount of suffering: from heavy equipment, from weather, from boots. I was determined to minimize unnecessary suffering where possible, and so I began investigating ultralight backpacking.

In ultralight, there's a bit of focus on using the latest technologies to reduce pack weight, which elevates comfort while hiking. But there's also a bent towards minimalism; or at least, I prefer to interpret it as not bringing equipment that will interfere with connection with nature, which for me is the reason to be in the wilderness.

With this philosophy in mind, I bought a new pack, shelter, sleeping bag, and much assorted equipment.

Probably my most noteworthy choice was to use sandals for hiking: I've used lightweight and ultra-thin sandals for years, ever since practicing martial arts got me more in touch with my feet. My feet and ankles have strengthened considerably over the years, and my hiking sandals have already held up to some pretty serious dayhikes up mountains in the Northeast. I was confident they'd also hold up to backpacking too, since I'd be carrying as little weight as possible.

With all this prelude out of the way, I'll start talking about the actual trip!

# Planning
The original plan was to hike the Great Gulf Trail over two nights with a friend and my partner. This would have been a pretty tough outing, but the backpacking would have been manageable. We'd stay at a designated site as a base camp in the Gulf, before taking a day hike up the Mt. Washington head wall.

However, a few days before the start of the trip, it became increasingly clear that a front would be blowing through, with lots of rain the day we'd go up Mt. Washington. The White Mountains are notorious for bad weather, and especially Mt. Washington. I didn't want to take the chance of being greeted with freezing rain and hurricane-force winds, so I modified the plan.

My friend still wanted to go up one of the Presidentials while we were in the White Mountains, and both my partner and my friend decided they didn't want to stay for the rainy day. In the end, I ended planning for my friend and I to go up Mount Madison on day 1, then he'd bail when we hiked out the morning of day 2. Day 2 and 3 I'd have to myself, and I wanted to explore the Wild River region by Evans Notch to the east.

# Day 1
I arrived at the Great Gulf trailhead on Friday morning and met with my friend. Because I wanted to make sure that we'd have enough time for the dayhike up to Madison, we made pretty fast time into our base camp at the Bluff, a designated campsite with nice views of the Gulf.

This was my first time setting up a tarp shelter in the wild, so it was pretty awkward. My tarp, at 8.5 x 8.5 feet, seemed way to large for the tentpad, yet also seemed a little small when I thought about the rain that might be coming overnight. Since we were in a rush, I left it in an imperfect state and started heading up towards Madison.

For the way up, we took the Madison Gulf trail, which I have read is not that popular, and not overly maintained. The top half was especially fun, because we did some scrambling over large boulders. Also, a small spring ran down much of the boulder section, resulting in some very magical mini-caves with pools of water.

At the top of the trail, we emerged into the alpine zone and a very stiff wind. I had brought both a rain jacket and a puffy (which I lent to my friend), so fortunately we were well prepared. I was already pretty tired, I was really grateful for a stop at Madison hut before continuing to the peak. I grabbed a candy bar and water, then headed for the summit.

With hiking sandals, I always have to be thinking about the placement of my feet. This was especially so up on the ridge, which was composed almost entirely of sharp and rough boulders. Even though my feet are getting stronger, I think that at this point they were pretty tired of balancing on edges and gripping sharp angles. It all held up though, and my friend and I made a short stop at Madison summit for some great views (and pictures!) before heading down the Osgood Trail back towards camp.

I was even more tired at this point, and not very excited about the prospect of even more sharp boulder and exposed ridgeline hiking. But at least it was downhill! I was so excited when we finally made it below the ridgeline, and then into soft forest soil. Progress across the ridge was much slower than I expected, and I could see that our timeline would take us back to camp well after dusk. We were prepared, though, having brought headlamps, so there was no big worry, especially since we got into the trees before dark.

After making it back to camp in the dark, we got right to dinner. I had Israeli couscous with a japanese curry brick, a packet of mustard greens, pieces of salami, and one small carrot. Fancy! After chatting with my friend, I fixed up my tarp a little better (I guess I do enjoy fiddling with knots) and went to bed.

# Day 2
I woke up in the morning and it wasn't raining yet! But then a few minutes later, as I was sitting under the tarp, it started coming down. I could see how my site setup left something to be desired, as water from the edge of the tarp then ran under it, and through where I would be sleeping if I didn't pack up everything quickly. My friend wasn't so lucky; his pad flooded and his tent got soaked. But he didn't really care, since he was on his way out anyways.

The rain dampened our enthusiasm for cooking breakfast, so we decided to head out right away. My umbrella came in handy (thanks to my Auntie in Taiwan for such a fashionable lightweight umbrella!), as it poured for several minutes as we were hiking. A passing hiker asked about my sandals; my feet were still warm despite it being wet, and I think the temperature was in the low 60s.

At the Great Gulf Trail trailhead, I parted ways with my friend, and decided to continue my trip. I still felt excited to be out, and I didn't feel wet and miserable. So I drove over to the trailhead at Basin Pond. I was pretty tired though, so I told myself I'd first aim for the minimal plan and see how I felt before attempting a more ambitious loop. This was a good idea, as I was much more tired than expected, and the hike was much harder than I expected.

The trailhead for the Basin Trail starts at Basin Pond, a small man-made reservoir. On this day, the surrounding mountains were shrouded in clouds, giving the pond a haunting quality. As the Basin Trail skirts the pond, it's relatively flat and easy, but once past it, begins to climb towards Rim Junction. I took a quick side trail to Hemlock falls; the trail was a bit unmaintained and hard to navigate, the the falls were not running strongly. Past the falls, the trail turns extremly steep and I was pretty exhausted from the previous day's hike. I probably stopped every 20 breaths or sofor the last half mile.

During this time, the rain also gradually let up. Throughout the rest of the day, there were sprinkles here and there, but the forest canopy kept me well-shielded.

Rim Junction is the intersection of several trails leaading into the Wild River Wilderness, as well as the Basin Rim Trail between the Royce and Baldface mountains. On a clear day, there's a beautiful view of Basin Pond, and then eastwards into Maine. Today, Rim Junction was completely enclosed in a cloud and I couldn't see more than a few hundred feet.

At this point, I checked with myself to see how much more hiking I was willing to do. My body still felt pretty exhausted, so I decided to just go to the nearest tentsite and relax. I headed towards Blue Brook Tentsite, just a half mile away. 

Of course, I had the hardest time finding the tentsite. I looked at the map, which marked the approximate location, and walked back and forth along the quarter-mile stretch it was supposed to be. No trace! I finally walked back a little farther to one of the trail intersections, and realized that the "extra" path I thought was just random, was actually the entrance to the tentsite. I'm glad I didn't push myself and get lost somewhere worse!

The Blue Brook Tentsite is really nice. The water source is the Blue Brook, at a spot where it cascades down a rock face. I spent some time here taking pictures and just admiring the water flow. It's interesting to think about what different kinds of patterns would emerge at different levels of waterflow.

Back at camp, I fiddled a lot with my tarp setup. Instead of the modified diamond I attempted the night before, I tried an A-frame. My first pitch was in a nook between some logs and a tree. It felt quite cozy, but after I was done, I looked up and saw a dead tree at the foot of the tarp! I decided not to chance it, and moved to one the tent pads. (Good thing too, the next day I saw many blow-downs on the highway as I drove home).

The tent pad was mostly dry, but I could see where water had pooled during the heavier rain earlier in the day. I pitched my A-frame over the edge of the pad, to try to avoid the puddle areas in case of more rain. I was hoping that having the tarp over the area draining into the pad might reduce water also.

I fiddled around here a while longer, trying to get a taut pitch. I think I did ok, and I probably needed more guyline for a truly taught pitch. But I also realized that I might not like fiddling around with tarps that much, even though I thought I would I like the flexibility of a square tarp. Perhaps a shaped tarp would allow as much feeling of connection to nature, while offering a more taut and protective pitch. Then I could hike more and appreciate the outdoors, instead of being immersed in my equipment.

As I took one more trip to admire Blue Brook, I met a couple who were taking some selfies there and also staying at Blue Brook. They were on day four of a five-day trip around the Wild River Wilderness. Sounded like a great trip! Although I was a little disappointed I wouldn't have the whole site to myself.

For dinner, I made a similar one-pot meal as the previous night: israeli couscous, japanese curry, fresh carrot, packaged salmon, chinese preserved vegetables. The preserved veggies were Lao Gan Ma brand, and it was a mistake not to try them out before going on the trail. I just emptied the whole packet, mildly noting that it seemed awfully red. I was sure it would be fine, because Lao Gan Ma chile sauce isn't really that hot. I was wrong! I actually couldn't even finish the pot! Luckily, I had brought a cold-soaking container in case I wanted to soak oatmeal for breakfast. I poured the remnants of dinner into it.

Then, with nothing else to do, I went to bed. I slept really fitfully, first because drops of water on the tarp were very loud, then because the wind howled through the trees. I think it was not so windy at ground level, the tarp barely flapped even though it wasn't taut. But the noise was pretty frightening!

# Day 3

The next morning, I woke up early (for me) at 6:30. I felt relatively fresh, so I decided to pack up right away and hike out to Moriah gorge.

This was my favorite day of hiking. The forest was still wet, but most puddles had drained away. It felt like there was some kind of glow leftover from the rain.

I hiked down the Basin Trail towards the Wild River Campground. Blue Brook ran parallel, and there were so many beautiful spots. I often felt kind of overwhelmed by how beautiful the forest was. It's different from the harshness and the majesty of the Presidentials; less to conquer, a bit more subtle, but just as much to appreciate.

This section of trail was pretty easy, and now that I felt good, I made good time. At Wild River Campground, I got turned around a few times but finally found the Wild River Trail. Completely flat and easy, I felt excited that I could cover more miles and see more things today.

The Wild River seemed to be really low. I had to ford it to connect to the Highwater trail on the other side of the river, so that I could catch teh Moriah Brook Trail up to the gorge. I'd be pretty scared to do this if water was high. As it was, I just got my feet a little wet (hooray for sandals) and felt good about using my hiking stick for suport.

Moriah Brook Trail was peaceful, and also quite muddy. A gentle incline (over several blowdowns and through several mud pits) led me to the gorge. It was impressive, but somehow not as interesting to me as the glimpses of Blue Brook I'd had early in the day.

Since the gorge was my endpoint, I checked the time to see if I might take the loop way back, adding another two miles or so. Back to the Highwater trail, I continued south across Moriah Brook. And suddenly, on the first uphill, I felt so tired! I didn't want to rush into an unknown section, pressed for time, while I was tired. So I decided to just doubled back and relax on the way back.

Funny thing, on the way back, I caught my second wind. I think I figured out something biomechanically, where I bent my knees more to walk (instead of shuffling?), and really felt my achilles tendon, and a spring in my step. Even going uphill I was flying. At Rim Junction, I took another picture, this time with Basin Pond fully revealed. As a late lunch, I drained my leftover dinner in a few gulps, and half-ran the rest of the way back.


# Trail Notes
Total mileage: 27 miles
Elevation Gain: 8265 feet

### Madison
The trail was much trickier than expected. For 5.5 miles I had expected about 5 hours, but it took closer to 7. The boulder fields on the ridge especially took a lot of time, especially coming down Osgood when I had hoped the downhill would be easier

### Wild River Wildereness
Basin Trail, on the west side, was pretty gentle and not difficult to hike. Quite a relief, I was half-expecting something like Madison from the day before. I would want to take less-experienced hikers here.

Hiking along the Wild River was not especially hard, but I did have to keep a look out for the trail. There were several washouts or re-routings, and no more bridges. Makes it more exciting! Having a GPS definitely helped me here.

Blue Brook Tentsite is quite nice, with great water source.

# Equipment Notes

### Sandals
I did all hiking in Shamma Warrior Sandals (no socks), including the boulder fields and the rainy day. In fact, I think that the sandals were a huge plus in wet weather, I never had to worry about wet/squishy shoes or socks, and my feet never felt cold while hiking.

Hiking in barefoot sandals is one of the primary reasons I've been able to get back into backpacking. I think my feet hate boots, and I've just wanted my feet to be able to feel more. No problems with twisted ankles (although I did fall once or twice). I got a pretty good bleeder from a scrape night-hiking, and stubbed my toes a few times. Still felt great! My feet felt so alive by the end of the trip, when I felt like I was flying along the trail.

I did have one issue with chafing on the right heel strap. Don't know if it's happened before, or if it will be a future issue (especially if I change my gait), but I had leukotape at the ready.

### Tarp
Revisiting my thoughts on tarps. I wanted light weight, simplicity, and connection to nature. I'd also thought that I wanted to master the skills needed to pitch a square tarp. But in the end, I think I just want to be outside with as little friction as possible. I think a good compromise might be Yama Mountain Gear's Cirriform, which for 2020 has a side entrance for great views and easy entry.

Also, I needed to bring more guyline and stakes. I brought 4 mini-groundhogs and 4 Ti shepard's hooks, but I ended up using the hooks for my bivy. I had six guylines, but they were only just enough for the A-frame pitch (which I hadn't really planned on using), and could have used 2-4 more guylines. Would be moot if I just get a Cirriform.

### Bug Bivy
I used a Mountain Laurel Designs bug bivy 2. I appreciated having a tub; I think the high sides stopped drafts when I unzipped my sleeping bag. I feel like the splash guards boxed me in a lot, and if I have a more protected shaped tarp would become unnecessary. The slipperyness of the silnylon was not fun. I really like the ridge-entry design. Might swap in the future, but no rush.

### Sleeping Pad
I used six sections of a Nemo Switchback. No problem sleeping on the pad; the ground was a bit cold for my legs, I might get a thinner pad for them or use my pack. Squeaks when hiking if sections rub together.

### Sleeping Bag
Feathered Friends Swallow. I had been debating getting a quilt, but went for this bag used. It's very warm and feels very comfortable, and love the zipper. This trip was not that cold though, temps to maybe 50. I was able to unzip completely to let my legs poke out.

I think that because I need to be able to move my legs, I'll eventually need a quilt. But I think I'll keep this bag around for colder nights until I figure out next steps. To be truly comfortable I'll probably need to make my own bag/quilt.G

### Backpack
I brought a Mountain Laurel Designs Burn. I wasn't sure how it would carry; it hadn't been all that comfortable on test runs in the Middlesex Fells. But I changed two things about how I packed:
1) I moved the foam pad from the interior (as I'd read would be good for structural support) to the outside pocket.
2) I kept heavy items at shoulder-blade height or higher. This removed the feeling of my pack being dragged downwards. Previously I'd packed them just below shoulder level (directly above sleeping bag).
With these changes, I felt comfortable with the pack, especially with good posture.

### Running tights/shorts
These worked so well. When I've hiked in mild heat previously, these never seem to get too hot. In this trip's rain, they got wet but never felt cold (temps probably in the 50-60F range). Dried really fast on my body, didn't hold a lot of water. In the past, with pants, they'd flap around and feel clingy/cold whenever it would rain. I'm super happy with this choice. (Also, I guess I don't really need shorts, but they're there for modesty). Tights were Under Armor, shorts were Baleaf. Maybe I'll get zebra stripes in the future to keep bugs away.

### Hiking Staff
I got a hiking staff from Z-packs. I like that it's lightweight and solid. The length was useful for fording the Wild River. And it was a convenient stick for one end of my A-frame tarp pitch. I think at this point I would never use it for walking, as it interferes with my gait. But I think it's still useful enough to bring. Probably the biggest pain was getting it in and out of my pack, I need to figure out a better system. Seems odd to say, but getting the staff in and out of my pack was one of the biggest points of friction while hiking.

### Food
I brought way too much. Probably the heaviest items were blocks of salami and cheese, neither of which I ate that much of. My breakfast/lunch was almost entirely cashews and cranberries, because I never really wanted to stop to eat. And then my dinner volume could probably have been halved (especially the packet of salmon was double what I needed). Cold soaking oatmeal probably would have worked out, I just didn't get around to it.

I guess my body didn't need the heavy fatty stuff as much as I thought it would. I'll probably avoid cheese/salami next time, and go more for nuts and PBJ

### Cooking and eating
Soto Amicus. Worked fine, no problems. I'm thinking about whether I should move to white gas stoves, even though they're heavier. I think that makes sense, as I feel like I'd primarily use it on group trips in the future, and move towards cold soaking for just my own food. The Soto Stormbreaker looks great (not having to deal with priming) but can only buy from Japan at the moment.

The pots I brought (a 500mL and 1000mL soto aluminum cookset) were way overkill for just me. But will probably work great on group trips. Since I'll just cold soak when solo, don't think I'll buy anything new here. I think I do need to figure out a better cleaning system; maybe a rag to just wipe down would be fine. My main concern is just food smells, and I'll probably store the pots on the bear cannister overnight.

For coldsoaking, the Litesmith cold-soak container worked great. No leaking.

### Bear cannister
I ended up taking a BV450, and recently received a Bare Boxer Contender. There's no particular issues with the BV450, except that it really doesn't like to stay strapped to the outside of my pack. This wasn't an issue on the last day, when I decided to just pack in inside the Burn. My gear is pretty low volume, so this was easy.

I also got an Ursack, but I'll probably give it up. I know some people complain about the weight of bear cannisters, but I just don't want to mess around with less-reliable methods of storing food, even at significant weight penalty. Hopefully the bears appreciate it too. A reason I want to go ultralight is so that my gear doesn't get in the way of my outdoors experience, not so that I chase grams.

### Water
My water system worked well. I had two CNOC bags and a HydroBlu inline water filter. One bag was connected to a platypus hose (via quick connect) for easy hydration. This worked so much better for me than drinking from a water bottle. I generally have issues keeping hydrated, and somehow have a hard time finding times to take a drink unless I'm completely parched. Being able to use a hose to drink was great, and I'll be sticking to it despite the small weight penalty.

For filtering, I didn't mind filtering water at camp. However, I didn't like having to stop when filtering water on the way back home. Perhaps next time I'll try out using the filter inline with the drinking hose.

### Caltopo
Caltopo was great for planning my trip and sharing my itinerary. For tracks, I hadn't really investigated closely, I need to figure out how to see a track and time spent, because otherwise I was stopping tracking at every major resting point. But the GPS definitely helped me feel secure that I was on the right track whenever my instincts warned me.

### Garmin InReach Mini
Used to send my partner preset messages like "Everything Ok", "Camping Here", "Heading Home". No problems, definitely worth the cost for me so that I can be safer and my partner doesn't worry as much.

### Fanny Pack
The best. I just bought a Thrupack Summit Bum. I wore it strapped over my shoulder on my chest, and it made everything I neede super accessible. Wallet, keys, headlamp, snacks, navigation, emergency supplies. Really made it easy to just keep walking.

### Umbrella
I liked it, would bring again. Thanks again to my Auntie from Taiwan, who gave me this lightweight and very fashionable umbrella.

### Jackets
I have an Feathered Friends Eos puffy, and a Marmot precip rain jacket. Used the puffy to keep me warm at camp when it was a bit wet (used under rain jacket). Rain jacket was great for cutting the wind on Madison, but I didn't use it when it was raining, I just wore a shirt. I'll continue to pack these two for basically every outing.

### Nylofume Bag
Used for back liner and storing food. No complaints so far.

### Headlamp
An old Petzl. I wish it had a red light, and it's a bit heavy (not the most comfortable). I'll probably look into alternatives.

### Cutting
I brought both a Mora Eldris, which works with a backup firesteel, as well as pair of scissors. I actually used both, but the knife was not needed if I prepped all my food ahead of time. I just used it to cut some carrots and salami for dinner. I'll probably bring both for a few more trips.

# Other notes
I guess I really don't like stopping to rest, nor taking off my pack. To me, this means I really need to make sure that everything I need for the day is in my 

I didn't use any insect repellant (I have picardin and permethrin ready but didn't use). I only got one bite, bug pressure was already non-existant, possibly because it's end of bug season + dry year so far. Of course, as soon as I got home and had to do a chore outside, I got ten bug bites.

I forgot my watch, and realized it about 20 minutes after I left home. It's pretty annoying to use my phone as a clock.
