Initial commit! It's a new beginning! Old blog posts are at [here](http://oldblog.hwc.io).

My last blog was mostly about my road from non-programmer to getting my first programming job. I discussed my job search, learning Haskell, and learning Rust. After getting a programming job, though, I had to devote most of my critical thinking energies to writing production-ready code.

Now, after 3 years of software development under my belt (and feeling more comfortable in the industry), I'm thinking on how I'll advance my career. I want to develop the skills to tackle harder and more interesting (to me) problems.

## Career thoughts

In particular, I want to do something more like research, where I get to think a long time on just a few problems at a time. I also have a desire to get back to my childhood dreams of understanding the universe (in a mostly physics way). And, I want to continue to explore the world of systems programming that Rust has opened up to me.

Ideally, I'd find a job that would combine applied math/physics and systems programming with a research bent. I know that I'm coming to this a bit late now (in my late 30s), but I'm definitely wiser, more resiliant, and more motivated than my young self.

I'm not totally unprepared in my quest to move my career in a more math/physics/research direction. I took math up through differential equations and linear algebra in college, and was just a little overwhelmed by school when I had expected it to be easy. I'm back with fighting spirit now, cultivated through Go, martial arts, and yoga.

So now that I've decided to move, I'm starting to take action:

## A plan for my career

#### Spring/Summer 2018
- relearn calculus (Strang)
- refresh linear algebra (Heffernon)
- learn probability

#### Fall 2018 - Spring 2020
Harvard Extension math/physics classes
  - 4 semesters and 2 summers
  - I hope I'd be able to take at least 6 courses in this time

#### Fall 2020

Apply to grad school? I would probably want to study applied math and/or complex systems, related to phenomena like turbulence.

I don't know if I'd want to to a master's or a phd at this point. Or maybe even nothing! If I could get a good job. I'd probably go for a degree only if I knew it would allow me to study something in particular, or get a certain job.

If anything, I'm probably biased against getting a degree. I just want to be prepared to do whatever I need to get the kind of job I want.

## Fun stuff in the meantime

- going through computational physics book (Newman)
- more rust! I love writing tools and services in rust
- playing more piano (if I have time, learn jazz)
- continue playing/teaching Go a little
- table tennis
- continue yoga. Maybe I'll have a handstand press by Fall 2020!
