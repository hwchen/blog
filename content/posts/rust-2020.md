Every year there's a call for blogs reflecting on goals for Rust for the upcoming year.

For me, the theme is "Community First".

As I mentioned in last year's post, people and the community are the driving forces behind Rust the language and Rust the ecosystem. Without the energy of developers, documenters, testers, users, Rust will wither away, regardless of its technical merits.

I still feel the same way.

Community building efforts are key. This includes things like the rustc learning group and high quality learning materials. Welcoming new developers and building stronger ties creates the necessary social structure to take on the complexities of a project like Rust.

Finally, as a community of developers, I think we naturally think of language features which would improve our own productivity. But I'd like Rust, as an organization and community, to think as much about growing its social resources.
