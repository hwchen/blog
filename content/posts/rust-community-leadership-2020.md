Who provides leadership in the open source community?

I'm asking this question in the context of the tension between `tokio` and `async-std` async stacks. Since this is a general #Rust2020 post, I'm not here to hash out specific details on events, but this [reddit thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/dse875/2020_be_open_and_friendly/) is the catalyst.

Without taking sides or going into detail, I just want to say that tension (and rifts) may arise in communities. This tension absolutely affects the community when the rift is large enough, and the players powerful enough. The tension may never be resolved, and I don't think it's anybody's job to make that happen. However, the community must still move on, even while the tensions exists.

The reason I'm writing this post is because I don't believe that this is an isolated incident; splits can develop at any time, and I'm sure the async ecosystem isn't the last time this will happen. So, I'm hoping to answer a deeper question of whether the Rust community can find a sustainable way forward.

The conflict itself doesn't make either of the parties bad people. The conflict itself only means that the different sides have different values (whether technological or social), which can surface as more bitter and personal disputes. And I don't believe that the path forward is to find or assign blame from the outside.

For me, the answer has to involve some sort of leadership. I don't believe that any good will come of a completely hands-off approach, where the general community only sees parts of fights bubble to the surface without any context. With no control over narrative, outsiders to the conflict can easily just assume the worst of the players in any given event. In the worst case, I can envision a pile-on of attacks from the most vocal parts of the general community, leading to demotivation and burnout for the primary parties of the conflict.

But what does it mean to have leadership? I don't think there's any easy answers here. The Rust organization is the de facto leader in the Rust world, but they are very careful to avoid meddling in ecosystem and community discussions where their involvement might be construed as favoritism. And I would guess that having a top-down leadership of ecosystem efforts would not work very well for Rust's open source model. There are times, though, when it would be great to have a respected third party to say, "Hey, these two are going to fight, but the rest of you don't need to 

So in the end, I don't think I have an answer as to the path forward on things like the async rift, but I'd like this post to reframe the discussion
